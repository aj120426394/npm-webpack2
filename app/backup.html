      <h3>Constructive Alignment</h3>
      <p>John Biggs, an Australian, who went to live and work in England, theorised that for learning to be most effective for the students in our classes we needed to design that learning with a focus on aligning all of the elements of the learning; in his theory this includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>what</b> we want them to learn (Learning Outcomes)</li>
        <li><b>how</b> we are going to determine if they have learned it (assessment), and</li>
        <li>the way we are going ot go about <b>offering</b> them <b>opportunities</b> to learn those things (learning activities).</li>
      </ul>
